INTRO                                              vim-autocite-intro

Autocite is a vim plugin to easily complete citation tags based on the contents of bibtex files. It searches for included bibfiles in the document and/or the directory where it is stored.

It currently supports the asciidoc-bib convention for citation tags in txt files. Although it should be easy enough to modify to include other file extensions and tag styles.

The core functionality for this plugin is extracted from Karl Yngve's vim-latex plugin.
=============================================================================
OPTIONS                                            vim-autocite-options

Enable the search of bibfiles in the directory where the edited document is stored.

    let g:autocite_search_in dir=1

Enable/Disable the search of bibfiles specified inside the document with ```bibtexfile:``` (default: 1)

    let g:autocite_search_in_doc=1


=============================================================================
USAGE                                              vim-autocite-usage

Bibliography (*.bib) files are searched for by default in the
 directory where the document being edited is stored. Bibliography files can also be included by adding to the
document commented lines such as:

// bibtexfile:/full/path/to/my/bibliography/my_bib.bib


Once vim-autocite is capable of finding your bibliography
files you only have to start writing your citation with
the [Asciidoc-bib](https://github.com/petercrlane/asciidoc-bib)
conventions:

[cite:]
[citenp:]


after the colon write some clue and \<Control-X\>\<Control-O\> to
trigger the autocompletion menu. A clue may be the last name of
an author, part of the title or bibtex label for the article.

=============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS                                       vim-autocite-requirements

Vim-autocite requires that bibtex is installed.

=============================================================================
THANKS                                             vim-autocite-thanks

The core of the script has been scavenged from [vim-latex](https://github.com/lervag/vim-latex) so vim-autocite
wouldn't be possible without Karl Yngve Lervag.
